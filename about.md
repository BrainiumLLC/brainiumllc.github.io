We're Brainium Studios, a mobile game company based in Portland, OR. We care about every little detail, and more than anything, we're passionate about crafting the best experience for our users. While we've always done our best to demonstrate that through [our games](http://www.brainiumstudios.com/site/index.html#games), now we'd like to show you how we apply the same philosophy to the software engineering behind them.

After over a decade of developing games with C++, we're building up a brand new stack in Rust, most of which we'll be open sourcing in the not-too-distant future. [cargo-mobile]({% post_url 2020-11-23-cargo-mobile %}) is the first of these, and look forward to the eventual release of Brainstorm, our mobile-first game engine!

If you think we sound unbelievably cool, check out our current [job listings](http://www.brainiumstudios.com/site/careers.html)!
